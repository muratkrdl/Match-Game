## The minimum number of same colored blocks to create a blastable group is 2. 

## Total number of colors (K) in a game can be varied between 2 to 6 

## all colors should have a different icon for easier recognition by the player. 

## Board can have 2 to 10 rows (M) and 2 to 10 columns (N).

## As the number of pieces in the group increases the pictures of the pieces change with an effect so that the player can see larger groups more easily.
